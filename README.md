# Data Analysis EDA Project

This project demonstrates how to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a real-world dataset using Python. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns, identify data quality issues, and generate meaningful insights to inform future decisions.

## 📌 Project Objective

- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset  
- Explore relationships between key features  
- Detect outliers, missing values, and anomalies  
- Visualize distributions and trends to support deeper analysis  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key EDA Tasks

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed null values, handled duplicates, converted data types
- **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution plots, value counts, and box plots
- **Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis**: Correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, groupby summaries
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new columns to enrich insights
- **Visualization**: Used Seaborn and Matplotlib for clear data storytelling

## 📈 Sample Insights

- Identified most common categories and feature relationships  
- Detected skewed data and applied transformations  
- Found patterns in time-based data that suggested seasonality
